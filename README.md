==HOW TO GET THE LARGE FILES==
To get the haks, you need to use the Command Line

Create a folder where you want to download, and then open the command terminal to that folder.

Install git large file storage
https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage

Then use the command
"gh repo clone leoendethas/ForestOfMirBuilders"

This will have git clone and properly get the large files.
This is faster than downloading via other means.

==FORWARD==
This is the Build Module for the Foprest of Mir, it has All the haks, and none of the code. 

If there are any issues loading, let Leoendethas know. This will be updated slower than the main module as the main module will not be adding many art assets. 

This is 30 Gigs, there are a shit ton of assets. I tried to deduplicate what I could so far.

==HOW TO USE==
Simple, put the files in your NWN folders of the same name! Then launch the Toolset and open the Module file!

MAKE SURE you initially create the area with a RESREF/Tag as the name then rename it to be player readable it. 

Put any used RESREF/Tag on the Discord in the Area CHannel so people know what you used. IF YOU DO NOT DO THIS YOUR area001 WILL CONFLICT WITH OTHERS.

Example -

Once you make an area, Export it!

IMPORT AND EXPORT WITHOUT RESETTING TO PARENT FACTIONS.
